# Connect To Care Volunteer Platform
###### (Client)
Connect To Care aims to provide everyone a chance to be the change in their lives and empower themselves to carve their own future.

As part of this initiative, we've developed our own custom volunteer platform that supports our needs as a non-profit.

## Development strategy
We use Angular to maintain a clean codebase and because of its extensive library of tools.
## Building
Clone the Github repo and install the Angular CLI using `npm i @angular/cli -g`. You can build the app using `ng build --prod` (production) and host a live development server using `ng serve`
## Contributing
We would love any extra help. Most of our priorities have been to suit our own needs. However, we would be happy to include features that are community contributed.
